# SIFT-Keypoint-Matching

This project demonstrates how to detect and match keypoints between two images using the **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** algorithm in OpenCV. It uses the **FLANN-based matcher** for robust feature matching and displays the matched keypoints between two grayscale images.

## Features
- Load and process two grayscale images
- Detect keypoints using SIFT
